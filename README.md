# Noetic---HackHer---2021
This repository contains C code intended to triage people for an app called Noetic. 

The user answers several questions that are then responded with self care suggestions.

There are four files included in this repository. Please be sure to include all four files to ensure you are able to run the code on your machine.
File 1: Header file to link my functions and main code
File 2: Function file where all of the functions are stored
File 3: Main 'Triage' code
File 4: Cmake file

All code was written by myself safe for the breathing() function that provides a choice of guided, follow-along breathing excercises (written by Cassie Greidanus).
